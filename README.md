How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is a critical aspect of software development that requires many strategies to accomplish. I start by creating a list of the requirements and what the clients needs are. After getting the list I'll start writing code in smaller increments. This allows me to test the code to ensure it is error free before moving onto the next section of code. I try to keep a consistent style throughout the program to ensure it is uniform and easy to read with comments to detail what the code is doing. I also use meaningful naming conventions for the variables, functions, and classes. The advantages of using CRUD were the simplicity it offered where creating the code gradually got easier to understand and implement. CRUD allowed for the project to have scalibity, where the project started off with the CREATE and READ functions, that were tested in jupyter notebook to ensure that the code was functioning. From there I created the update and delete fuctions before expanding the project further to include the dashboard in project two. The entire process made learning MongoDB, creating the CRUD functions, and using Jupyter Notebook to test the code and finish off creating a dashboard with multiple interactive widgets.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The approach I take when I encounter a problem is to first look for where the error is coming from, looking into what the output is producing before searching for related issues online, using resources like stackoverflow.com or Google. From there I will make the necessary changes to the code while testing multiple times to ensure that the code is functioning properly after the changes. The last step would be to add comments to ensure that the new changes have documentation. For the projects in this course the biggest problem i encountered was properly connecting MongoDB with the python file and Jupyter Notebook. Once I had the correct implementation of the code the remaining parts of the projects were pretty seemless since we gradually built our code and tge dashboard. Most errors i found were syntax errors or indentation errors where the fix were extremely simple.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

The project I created for Grazioso Salvare allows them to have an up to date dashbaord of all the rescue animals in the AAC database with widgets showing relatable information to their needs. That allows Grazioso to be more productive while having the most comprehensive and updated information on every dog in their system. The role of a computer scientist can be quite robust in the sense that they work across various domains such as algorithmic theory, programming languages, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, network design, databases,etc. They are expected to be versatile, adaptable, and resiliant to the dynamic and challenging issues that arise in these areas.
